        <h2>Unified RGB LED Illumination</h2>
        <p>
            Spectral provides unified RGB LED illumination for your games and applications made with Unreal Engine, Unity, .NET, and C++. By implementing the Spectral library, your games and applications can control the RGB LED illumination on devices on all supported brands (e.g. Logitech, Corsair) instead of only the devices of a specific brand. Due to limitations of the devices, Spectral only works for games and applications on the Windows desktop platform. Spectral will fail gracefully for unsupported platforms.
        </p>
        
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        
        <h2>Unreal Engine Support</h2>
        <p>
            The Spectral plugin for Unreal Engine has support for both Blueprints visual scripting and C++ programming. Using Blueprints, you can easily add support for RGB LED illumination to your games and applications or you can use the power of C++ to implement more advanced effects. All Blueprint nodes and C++ methods are documented with Blueprint node tooltips and C++ IntelliSense support to easily understand how it works.
        </p>
        
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        
        <h2>Unity Support</h2>
        <p>
            The Spectral plugin for Unity allows you to program RGB LED illumination effects to use with your games and applications. The plugin source code is documented with IntelliSense support and an example implementation has been provided.
        </p>

        <div class="py-2"></div>
        
        <h2>C++ Support</h2>
        <p>
            A C++ wrapper for Spectral is available. It can be used to implement RGB LED Illumination support in your C++ games and applications as well as in other game engines that can be extended with C++. The source code is documented and has IntelliSense support.
        </p>
        
        <div class="py-2"></div>
        
        <h2>.NET Support</h2>
        <p>
            A .NET wrapper for Spectral has been written in C# using .NET Standard 2.0. It can be used to implement RGB LED Illumination support in your .NET Framework, .NET Core, and MonoGame games and applications. The source code is documented and has IntelliSense support.
